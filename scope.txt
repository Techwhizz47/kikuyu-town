This Is a blog site I want you to build with express and EJS.
1. Have the pages highlighted in the navbar.
2. Render the content in the pages dynamically with EJS Tags( Do  not write content manually in elements).
3. Add another navLink in the navbar called Blog/News then from there let there be a anchor element saying add Blog,
when clicked it takes you to a page with a form having a title, Details and image inputs and a button that when clicked
 it uploads the data to be showcased in the blog page.
4. CATCH: If possible you can try to implement firestore as your database and storage as your image database.
5. Styling I would like you to implement You can style as mine or use yours if possible.
6. Styling in public folder
7. Middleware (app.use(express.static("public"));)
8. firestore database for files
9. Create get request for the pages that you have[eg. about, Contact]
10. The route endpoints of the get request you have set,  set them to be the href attributes of the the navbar links
